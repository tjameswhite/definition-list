<h1 id="screen-readers-and-definition-lists">Screen Readers and Definition Lists</h1>
<p>I created a simple test file (<a href="https://codepen.io/tjameswhite/full/KKBaNaM">Definition List</a>) using sample mark up from Mozilla’s mdn web docs (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl">&lt;dl&gt;: The Description List element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN</a>)</p>
<p>Tested three combinations of screen readers and browser: Jaws &amp; Edge; VoiceOver and Safari, and Chrome. All browsers and screen readers used default settings.</p>
<p>The test consists of four definition list options: 1. 1 term and 1 definition 2. 3 terms and 1 definition 3. 1 term and 2 definitions 4. group of 4 consisting of 1 term and 1 definition each</p>
<h2 id="jaws-edge">Jaws &amp; Edge</h2>
<p>Tested the four options, in order, Jaws announced the following. Tested used down arrow to progress one by one through each list. (Note: I have truncated the full copy for sake of brevity.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Definition list of 1 items. Firefox. A free … . List end”</li>
<li>“Definition list of 3 items. Firefox. Mozilla Firefox. Fx. A free … . List end.”</li>
<li>“Definition list of 1 items. Firefox. A free … . The Red Panda … . List end.”</li>
<li>“Definition list of 4 items. Name. Godzilla. Born. 1952. Birthplace. Japan. Color. Green. List end.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Observation: - Jaws announces “items”(plural) even when there is only 1 item. ## Voiceover and Safari</p>
<p>Tested same order and manner as Jaws. Tested by moving through the lists one item at a time.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Description list 1 item. Firefox 1 of 2. A free … . 2 of 2. End of description list.”</li>
<li>“Description list 3 items. Firefox 1 of 4. Mozilla Firefox 2 of 4. FX 3 of 4. A free … . 4 of 4. End of description list.”</li>
<li>“Description list 2 items. Firefox 1 of 3. A free … . 2 of 3. The Red Panda … . 3 of 3. End of description list.”</li>
<li>“Description list 4 items. Name 1 of 8. Godzilla 2 of 8. Born 3 of 8. 1952 4 of 8. Birthplace 5 of 8. Japan 6 of 8. Color 7 of 8. Green 8 of 8. End of description list”</li>
</ol>
<p>Observations: - Voiceover refers to definition lists as “description list”. - Voiceover considers the ‘length’ of the list based on the number of <code>dt</code> (term) elements. - Despite the number of items being determined by the number of <code>dt</code> elements, all elements end up being counted.</p>
<h2 id="voiceover-and-chrome">Voiceover and Chrome</h2>
<p>This was an accidental test. I started testing and realized I was in Chrome. I decided to finish the test anyway. Same test procedure as Safari.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Definition list 2 items. Firefox. A free … . 2 of 2. End of definition list.”</li>
<li>“Definition list 4 items. Firefox 1 of 3. Mozilla Firefox 2 of 3. FX. A free … . 4 of 4. End of definition list.”</li>
<li>“Definition list 3 items. Firefox. A free … . 2 of 3. The Red Panda … . 3 of 3. End of definition list.”</li>
<li>Definition list 8 items. Name 1 of 4. Godzilla 2 of 8. Born 2 of 4. 1952 4 of 8. Birthplace 4 of 8. Japan 6 of 8. Color. Green 8 of 8. End of definition list.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Observations: - Voiceover did not enumerate all items, skipping one in each list. In the 1st and 3rd tests, after Firefox VO did not announce “1 of”. Test 2 it did not announce “3 of 4” after FX. And the final test did not announce “4 of 4” after Green - VO in Chrome appears to partially distinguish terms (<code>dt</code>) from definitions (<code>dd</code>). In the second test, for example, while announcing 4 items, VO then announced the terms as “1 of 3” etc. The same can pattern emerges with the final test where there are 4 pairs of terms and definitions. VO announces 8 total items, and counts the terms as “x of 4”.</p>
